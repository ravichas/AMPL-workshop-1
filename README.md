# AMPL-workshop-1

# NCI Data Science Learning Exchange Hands-on Tutorial: 
## *ATOM Modeling Pipeline (AMPL) for Drug Discovery*
*Presented by S. Ravichandran, Ph.D., BIDS, ATOM, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR)*

In this workshop, we will demonstrate how to use Atom Modeling PipeLine (AMPL; https://github.com/ATOMconsortium/AMPL), a new, open-source conda-based software that automates key drug discovery steps. AMPL is designed to take molecular binding data (ex., IC50, ki, etc.) and carry out the ML steps listed in the figure above with minimal user intervention. The first workshop will introduce AMPL and highlight AMPLâ€™s capabilities for creating ML-ready datasets. Follow-on workshops will be offered during the summer and will cover modeling methods and inference. 

The workshop on June 8 will include two parts, a short presentation followed by a hands-on tutorial. 


To begin: 

* Click the launch Binder button below to begin tutorial using the dynamic version of **predict-drugclass.ipynb**.

  [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ravichas/ML-predict-drugclass/master)
  
* Click on "predict_drugclass_COLAB.ipynb" to open the tutorial in Google COLAB

 * ***Please note that Binder server setup on the cloud will take < 3 minutes at most. You will first see a Binder page with some log messages. After the setup, you will see an instance of Jupyer notebook in your browser. Click the Jupyter notebook, predict-drugclass.ipynb, to begin the tutorial***.
  
  * *Binder does not work with Safari on Mac OS, instead use the Chrome browser. If you are on Windows, please use Chrome.*


* If you have trouble with Binder, click **predict-drugclass.ipynb** above to view a static Python JupyterNotebook.
